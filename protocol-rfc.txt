RFC 2223       Protocol client/server communications      November 2020


1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this RFC is to define the communication rules using a
   binary protocol between a server and a client.
   Communication is established for the purpose of enabling the proper
   functioning of a 2D multi-player video game, known as R-TYPE.

   The server MUST communicate with the client using UDP protocol.
   However a second communication using the TCP protocol is tolerated
   but a good justification be given.
   In all-games every communications MUST be done in UDP.

2.  Secure Client Connection

   To ensure a good connection between the server and the client we
   decided to use the TCP protocol for the first connection between the
   client and the server.
   The choice of using the TCP protocol is that the first to the server
   connection MUST be secure and no packets should be lost to ensure
   that the client was able to communicate with the server.

3.  Lobby TCP Packages

   Once the secure connection is established between the client and the
   server, the client MAY send two TCP types of packets to the server.
   And MUST return two other types of packets for responses.

   3a.  Package Creation Lobby

      The first packet is to ask the server to create a new game, the
      packet is called createNewGame.

      The first variable in the packet MUST contain the type of the
      packet.

      Once the createNewGame packet arrives at the server, the server
      will create a lobby for the client and send a packet confirming
      the creation of the lobby, the packet is called
      replyLobbyCreated.

      The first variable in the packet MUST contain the type of the
      packet.

      The second variable MUST contain a std::size_t idGame to see
      which lobby the client is in.

      The client MUST send this packet if they want to be the creator
      of the lobby.

RFC 2223       Protocol client/server communications      November 2020

   3b.  Package Reply Creation Lobby

      The first response packet concerns the createNewGame packet, as
      soon as the server receives the createNewGame packet from the
      client the server will create a lobby and send the
      replyGameCreated packet back to the server

      The first variable in the packet MUST contain the type of the
      packet.

      The second variable MUST contain a std :: size_t idGame for the
      identifier of the lobby in which to connect.

      The third variable MUST be the player's index in the lobby.

   3c.  Package Join Lobby

      The second package is to ask the server to join an already
      existing lobby, the package is called connectionLobby.

      The first variable in the packet MUST contain the type of the
      packet.

      The second variable MUST contain a std::size_t idGame for the
      identifier of the lobby in which to connect.

      The client MUST enter the lobby identifier if he wants to send
      the packet connectionLobby.

   3d.  Package Reply Join Lobby

      The second response packet concerns the connectionLobby packet,
      as soon as the server receives the connectionLobby packet from
      the client the server will make the client join the lobby
      concerned by the first request.

      The first variable in the packet MUST contain the type of the
      packet.

      The second variable MUST contain a std::size_t idGame for the
      identifier of the lobby in which to connect.

      The client MUST enter the lobby identifier if he wants to send
      the packet connectionLobby.

4.  Game UDP Packages

   Once the creator of the lobby has decided to launch the game alone
   or with others, the game will start and all the requests that will
   now pass between the server and the client will be in UDP.

   4a.  Package sendDataPlayers

      When the game is launched, the server will send the client the
      position of all the players present on the game, the package is
      called sendDataPlayers.

      The first variable in the packet MUST contain the type of the
      packet.

      The second variable MUST contain a std::size_t idGame to see
      which game the client is in.
