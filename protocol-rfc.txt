RFC 2223       Protocol client/server communications      November 2020


1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this RFC is to define the communication rules using a
   binary protocol between a server and a client.
   Communication is established for the purpose of enabling the proper
   functioning of a 2D multi-player video game, known as R-TYPE.

   The server MUST communicate with the client using UDP protocol.
   However a second communication using the TCP protocol is tolerated
   but a good justification be given.
   In all-games every communications MUST be done in UDP.

2.  Secure Client Connection

   To ensure a good connection between the server and the client we
   decided to use the TCP protocol for the first connection between the
   client and the server.
   The choice of using the TCP protocol is that the first to the server
   connection MUST be secure and no packets should be lost to ensure
   that the client was able to communicate with the server.

3.  Lobby TCP Packages

   Once the secure connection is established between the client and the
   server, the client MAY send two TCP types of packets to the server.

   3a.  Package Creation Lobby

      The first packet is to ask the server to create a new game, the
      packet is called createNewGame.

      The createNewGame package contains a variable to store type of the
      package.

      Once the createNewGame packet arrives at the server, the latter
      will create a lobby for the client and send a packet confirming
      the creation of the lobby, the packet is called
      replyLobbyCreated.

      The first variable in the package is the type of the package.

      The second is a std :: size_t idLobby to see which lobby the
      client is in.

      The client MUST send this packet if they want to be the creator
      of the lobby.

   3b.  Package Join Lobby

      The second package is to ask the server to join an already
      existing lobby, the package is called connectionLobby.

      The first variable in the package is the type of the package.

      The second is a std :: size_t idLobby for the identifier of the
      lobby in which to connect.

      The client MUST enter the lobby identifier if he wants to send
      the packet.

4.  Game Launch on UDP

   Once the creator of the lobby has decided to launch the game alone
   or with others, the game will start and all the requests that will
   now pass between the server and the client will be in UDP.

   4a.  Loading the Game

      When the game is launched, the server will send the client the
      position of all the players present on the game.
